# Ableton Live 12 on Linux
![Project in Live](LiveDemo.png)

<br>

This project brings you the Linux build of Ableton Live 12 that ships inside the Push 3 recovery image as a normal desktop app. With some custom shims it transforms it into a fully functional Live 12, but running natively on Linux. The content the image lacks (Core Library, lessons, stem models, cursors, icon) comes from the Windows Suite installer.

Ableton's files are not modified, and this repository contains none of them. A small launcher starts Live with a shim library preloaded. The shim makes Live work on the desktop: window, menus, file dialogs, plug-in editors, audio through PipeWire, mixed-scale monitors, Push hardware and Max for Live device views.

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Ableton. Licensing is not touched: Live starts unauthorized, and you authorize it with your own Ableton account as usual.

<br>

## Requirements

### IMPORTANT: Due to this binary being compiled specifically for Push 3, which runs 11th Gen Intel CPU, it is restricted to AVX-512 instructions. Said instructions currently run only on <u>AMD Ryzen 7000 series</u> and above, and <u>Intel Core 10th and 11th Gen</u>.

<br>

Other requirements:
- An x86-64 PC with PipeWire, and glibc 2.35 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04, Mint 21, Debian 12, Fedora 36 or newer).
- An X11 session or Xwayland. Every mainstream desktop has one; Live runs as an X11 program.
- `python3`, used by the installer to complete the browser's device catalog. Without it, Instruments, Audio Effects, MIDI Effects, Modulators and Max for Live stay empty (see [The browser's device categories](#the-browsers-device-categories)).
- About 25 GB of free space while installing, and about 7 GB after (4.5 GB program, 2.1 GB Core Library).

<br>

### Install the tools the installer needs with one command:

| Distribution | Command |
|---|---|
| Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, CachyOS | `sudo pacman -S --needed unzip e2fsprogs pipewire-alsa` |
| Debian 12+, Ubuntu 22.04+, Mint 21+ | `sudo apt install unzip e2fsprogs pipewire-alsa` |
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install unzip e2fsprogs pipewire-alsa` |
| openSUSE | `sudo zypper install unzip e2fsprogs pipewire-alsa` |

You do not need to install `innoextract`. The installer brings its own (see [innoextract](#innoextract)).

<br>

## Install
1. Create a new folder.
2. Clone this repository into a folder.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/velkajelka/linux-native-ableton.git
   cd linux-native-ableton
   ```

   Or without git:

   ```sh
   curl -L -o linux-native-ableton.zip https://github.com/velkajelka/linux-native-ableton/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   unzip linux-native-ableton.zip
   cd linux-native-ableton-main
   ```
3. You need your own copies of:

   - the Push 3 recovery image 2.4.7, available [here](https://cdn-downloads.ableton.com/hardware_updates/push3/2.4.7/Push3-RecoveryImage-2.4.7.zip)
   - the Windows installer of Live 12.4.7 Suite, available [here](https://cdn-downloads.ableton.com/channels/12.4.7/ableton_live_suite_12.4.7_64.zip)

   You can also access them on https://www.ableton.com/en/download/archive/ (but you need an account to download it from there).
4. Put both zips into the same folder, next to `install.sh`.
5. Run `install.sh`. Double-click it (it opens a terminal window that shows the progress and stays open at the end), or run it in a terminal:

   ```sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

GNOME Files opens scripts in the text editor by default. There, right-click `install.sh` and choose "Run as a Program", or use the terminal.

The program goes to `~/.local/share/ableton-live-12`. Use `--prefix DIR` for another folder; the path must not contain spaces or quotes. The installer adds Ableton Live 12 to the application menu. `.als`, `.alp` and `.auz` files and `ableton://` links (used for browser authorization) open in it.

The installation takes about 3 to 6 minutes and shows each step with a progress bar. You can delete the zips afterwards.

### Program loader

Live asks for the program loader at `/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`. Arch has it. Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and Fedora have it only at `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`.

When the link is missing, the installer asks `Create it now with sudo? [Y/n]`. Press Enter and type your password. This link is the only change outside your home folder. If you skip it, the installation still finishes, but Live does not start until you create the link:

```sh
sudo ln -s /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```

### If the installation stops

Run `install.sh` again. It continues after the last finished step ("done by an earlier run") and needs less free space for the rest.

- The tools' messages are in `install.log` in the install folder. When a step fails, the installer shows its lines.
- A zip that is still being copied or downloaded, or is damaged, is reported as "not a complete zip".
- If the disk is full, the installer says so.
- Run on a complete installation, the installer asks "Install it again?". Your settings, licence and libraries stay. It refuses while Live is running.

<br>

## Uninstall

```sh
~/.local/share/ableton-live-12/uninstall.sh
```

It removes the program, the Core Library and the menu entry. Your User Library, recordings and projects in `<Music>/Ableton` always stay.

It asks whether to delete Live's settings and licence too (default: keep them). `--purge` deletes them without asking. It also asks whether to remove the loader link, if the installer made it. It refuses while Live is running.

<br>

## Not available in this build

While this appears like a fully functional build, it does not include some of the features the Windows build has, such as:

REX loops, VST2 (VST3 works), EXS24/SoundFont/Kontakt import, web views, video export, Pack downloads, screen-reader support, and media keys.

<br>

## Push hardware

Push 2 and Push 3 are supported. When Push hardware is connected, Live starts its companion program (`Push3`, from the Push 3 image) by itself; the companion drives the pads, the LED matrix and the display over USB. Leave the control-surface slots in Live's MIDI preferences at "None" — none of them is needed.

Because the companion owns the hardware directly, Push devices do **not** appear in Live's MIDI preferences. In particular, do not select the "Push2" control surface: it is the legacy path of the desktop builds, and its display process does not exist in this build — selecting it stalls Live for a moment and the hardware stays dark.

<br>

## The browser's device categories

Live lists built-in devices from entries its indexer builds out of the program's
`Builtin` folder. The Push 3 image's indexer never processes that folder — the
device did not need it — so **Instruments, Audio Effects, MIDI Effects,
Modulators and Max for Live** were empty, while Sounds and Drums (plain Core
Library content) worked.

The installer completes the catalog from the image's own content
(`tools/browser-catalog.py`): each device's declaration is added to the folder
Live already indexes that holds its presets, the Max devices and MIDI tools are
copied where Live indexes them, and the Modulators keyword entries are added to
the Core Library's metadata manifest. Idempotent, and nothing in Ableton's
program folder is modified.

If those categories are ever empty again — for example after resetting Live's
database — run it once and restart Live:

```sh
~/.local/share/ableton-live-12/tools/browser-catalog.py
```

<br>

## Max for Live device views

Max for Live devices draw their interface in their own native windows. On
Windows those windows are children of the device chain's window, so the OS
clips them together with it. On Linux Live draws its whole interface in one
window, and these views are children of it with nothing managing them, so the
shim takes that role. A 30 Hz manager reads the device chain's own list of
views and places each one on its device's frame; it hides the ones that are
out of view.

It follows the device chain through slow and fast scrolling, overview jumps,
left/right arrow navigation, adding or removing effects, track switches,
duplicated tracks and empty tracks. A view that scrolls out of the chain is
hidden, including the slivers Live leaves at the viewport edge; a view that
comes back appears over its device. This works at any UI zoom, including
values below 60 % in Live's Preferences, and after resizing the window or
switching between fullscreen and a narrow window. Animations and LFOs stay
smooth because the manager only re-lays a view out when its rectangle
actually changes.

**Before:** at 125 % each view sat about 350 px above its device frame and
filled only four fifths of it. Scrolling the chain could leave clipped slivers
over other devices; clicking away could leave views over the wrong device; and
a fullscreen-to-narrow change could blank or hide the rightmost views until
they were scrolled away and back.

**After:** the views sit exactly over their device's frame at any zoom and
display scale, and fill it. They follow the chain while it scrolls, hide when
their device leaves the viewport, and reappear over the device when it comes
back. They disappear whenever the detail area shows Clip view — and when it
is collapsed — and come back with the Device view, whichever way you switch
(the tabs, Shift+Tab, the View menu, or Alt+3 / Alt+4). A view that becomes
visible repaints immediately, including after a fullscreen change.

All of it follows Live's own detail-view state, so there is nothing to
configure. Three environment variables turn parts of it off for comparison:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `LIVE_M4L_MANAGER=0` | Disable the Max-view manager; Live's native view placement and hiding apply. |
| `LIVE_M4L_NOHIDE=1` | Keep the views on screen in Clip view. |
| `LIVE_MAX_SCALE=0` | Leave the Max runtime at its own scale. |

These hooks are written for Live 12.4.7 from the Push 3 image and check the
build before using it. On another build the manager stays inactive and the
views use Live's native behavior rather than guess.

<br>

## Audio and PipeWire

Live talks ALSA, and the shim sends its hardware accesses to PipeWire: Live's device menu lists PipeWire's outputs and inputs (card 100 is "System Default", which follows the desktop's choice), samples leave in floating point instead of being cut to 16 bits, and the sound shares the sound card with the desktop through `pipewire-alsa`.

PipeWire's graph cycles at its *quantum* (512 frames at 48 kHz on many systems; `pw-metadata -n settings` shows yours). The plugin feeds its stream out of Live's ALSA ring, and a ring shorter than a cycle drains before the next cycle refills it: every cycle then ends in an XRUN, hundreds per second, and the sound crackles or stays silent. Live's fresh-install default (three periods of 128 frames) is smaller than one cycle on such systems, so the shim lifts the ring to cover the quantum — Live's own buffer setting from that point on is respected as long as it stays above it.

The audio path has settings, all optional:

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `LIVE_ALSA_DEVICE=pcm` | The ALSA PCM Live's hardware opens go to (`pipewire` by default; `hw:...` for the raw card) |
| `LIVE_ALSA_EXCLUSIVE=1` | Direct hardware access, Live owns the card (as on the Push) |
| `LIVE_ALSA_FORMAT=device` | Leave the sample format to ALSA (default: the best of float/S32/S24) |
| `LIVE_ALSA_CHANNELS=n` | Cap the channel count Live opens (default: the device's own) |
| `LIVE_ALSA_PERIODS=n` | Periods in the ring (default 2; 3 is Live's own) |
| `LIVE_ALSA_MINRING=n` | The smallest ring, in frames (default: PipeWire's quantum; 0 disables) |
| `LIVE_AUDIO_THREADS=n` | Cap the audio worker threads Live creates (Live sizes them from the cpu count: 15 on a 16-core machine). Nothing is pinned — the threads still run on every core |

These can also be kept in `Options-desktop.txt`, as lines starting with `-_Live`: Live silently ignores unknown options of that shape (verified against 12.4.7), so they can sit in the file it reads, and the shim applies them itself. `-_LiveAudioThreads=8` does what `LIVE_AUDIO_THREADS=8` does, and survives every start.

<br>

## Where Live keeps its files

Live behaves like any Linux program and uses your home folder, the same places it uses on Windows and macOS:

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Settings, log | `~/.config/Ableton/Live 12.4.7/` |
| Licence, file database | `~/.local/share/Ableton/` |
| Core Library, User Library, recordings, Factory Packs | `<Music>/Ableton/` (your desktop's Music folder, for example `~/Music` or a translated name) |

Live finds plug-ins in the usual folders (`~/.vst3`, `/usr/lib/vst3`, `/usr/local/lib/vst3`). Plug-ins keep their own settings and licences, shared with other programs. Windows plug-ins work through yabridge.

<br>

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| Live does not start; a dialog names `/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` | The loader link is missing. Create it: `sudo ln -s /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` |
| "The audio engine is off" | Without `pipewire-alsa`, Live cannot share the sound card with the desktop. Install `pipewire-alsa` (see [Requirements](#requirements)), then restart Live. |
| The installer refuses the install folder | The path has a space or a quote. Live registers itself at every start through a command that does not quote its folder, so such a path gives an error dialog at each start. Choose another `--prefix`. |
| `innoextract` errors such as "Unexpected setup data version: 6.4.0.1" | Your system's innoextract is 1.9 or older. The installer uses its bundled copy first; check `install.log` for its messages. |
| `xdg-mime: ... qtpaths: command not found` in the terminal (Fedora) | Harmless. |
| Saving and exporting are deactivated | Live is not authorized yet. Authorize it with your Ableton account. |
| Push 2 or Push 3 stays dark or its LEDs keep flashing | Live's companion cannot open the USB device. Give the user read/write access to Ableton's USB devices (matches Push 2 and Push 3): `echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ATTR{idVendor}=="2982",MODE="0660",GROUP="audio"' \| sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ableton-push.rules && sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger`, then replug the hardware and restart Live. You must be in the `audio` group. |
| Audio crackles, and Live's log fills with `State=XRUN` | Live's ring is shorter than one PipeWire cycle. The shim lifts it to cover the quantum automatically; if your quantum is unusual (above 1024 frames), either raise Live's buffer to match (`pw-metadata -n settings` shows the quantum) or set `LIVE_ALSA_MINRING` (see [Audio and PipeWire](#audio-and-pipewire)). |
| A file dialog never appears and Live looks frozen (KDE on Wayland) | The desktop portal is a native Wayland client and cannot attach its dialog to Live's XWayland window. Wayland sessions use Qt's own dialogs for this reason; if a portal dialog still hangs, restart it with `systemctl --user restart plasma-xdg-desktop-portal-kde.service` and start Live again. `LIVE_NATIVE_DIALOGS=0` uses Live's own dialogs instead. |
| Instruments, Audio Effects, MIDI Effects, Modulators or Max for Live are empty | Live's browser catalog was not completed, or Live rebuilt its database after it was. Quit Live, run `~/.local/share/ableton-live-12/tools/browser-catalog.py`, and start Live again (see [The browser's device categories](#the-browsers-device-categories)). |
| Max for Live device views are misplaced, drawn small, stuck over other devices, or blank | The Max-view manager is inactive, or it did not recognize this Live build. It disables itself on a build whose layout, chain or rect-getter prologues do not match Live 12.4.7 from the Push 3 image; check that `LIVE_M4L_MANAGER` is not set to `0`. On a supported build, a view that becomes visible should repaint within a second; if it stays blank, note the window size and zoom when reporting it. |

## innoextract

Live 12.4.7's Suite installer is made with Inno Setup 6.4. innoextract 1.9, the latest release and the version most distributions ship, cannot read it ("Unexpected setup data version: 6.4.0.1"). Support for 6.4 exists only in innoextract's development code.

`tools/bundled/innoextract` is built from innoextract commit `6e9e34e`. Boost and libstdc++ are linked statically, and it needs glibc 2.35 or newer. If the bundled copy fails, the installer tries the system's innoextract. Fedora and openSUSE name the bzip2 library `libbz2.so.1`; the installer links it under the name innoextract expects, inside its work folder only.

## Third-party licences

- innoextract: zlib licence, see `tools/bundled/LICENSE.innoextract`.
- xkbcommon: MIT licence.
